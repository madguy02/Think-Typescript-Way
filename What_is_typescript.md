## So What Exactly is TypeScript?

### TYPESCRIPT = JAVASCRIPT + TYPE SYSTEM


## Common Facts about TypeScript:

- Typescript is just Javascript with a Type System.
- It has a compiler, which basically converts typescript to plain old javascript.
- The compiling mechanism of typescript helps you to catch Errors.
- Doesn't provide any performance optimizations, unlike some compiled languages which does.



#### P.S: At the end of the day, its just a helper to catch error in JS code. A syntactic sugar can we say?
